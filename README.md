Welcome to the Spam Mail Detection Project!

In this project, we will be using machine learning algorithms to detect spam emails. Our goal is to build a system that can accurately distinguish between legitimate emails and spam emails and help users to filter out unwanted messages.

Dependencies
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.6 or higher
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Don't worry if you don't have these dependencies installed, we have included a requirements.txt file that you can use to install them automatically.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Enron Spam Dataset. It contains information about emails, including their text content, subject line, and whether they are classified as spam or not.

Preprocessing
Before we can train our model, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, cleaning the text, and encoding the labels.

Training
We will train our model using the scikit-learn library's classification algorithms. This is a powerful algorithm that can handle text data and make predictions based on the content of the email.

Testing
To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we will use cross-validation and the accuracy metric. We will also generate a confusion matrix and a classification report to better understand the performance of our model.

Our program will preprocess the data, train the model, and test its accuracy. You can also modify the hyperparameters of the classification algorithm to see how it affects the accuracy of the model.

Conclusion
With this project, we hope to have a better understanding of how machine learning algorithms can be used to detect spam emails. We encourage users to use this system to filter out unwanted messages and protect themselves from phishing attacks. Remember, always be cautious when opening emails from unknown senders!
